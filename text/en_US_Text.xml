            <Text>The Tang Dynasty rose to prominence amidst the chaos at the end of the Sui Dynasty. Emperor Taizong, Li Shimin, devoted himself to diligent governance, ushering in the "Zhenguan Era of Good Governance." He refined the Three Departments and Six Ministries system, implemented the Equal-field, Tax System, and pacified the Turkic threats along the borders, laying the foundation for a golden age. During the Wu Zhou period, the legacy of Zhenguan continued, and the early reign of Emperor Xuanzong reached its zenith in the "Kaiyuan Prosperous Age." The empire's territory stretched east to Korea and west to Central Asia, with the "Anxi Frontier Command" governing the Western Regions. The capital, Chang'an, became an international metropolis where envoys from all nations paid tribute. The Silk Road trade flourished unprecedentedly, with markets bustling amid "fat-glutinous rice and snow-white millet" (a poetic depiction of abundance). Poetry, Buddhism, and exotic music and dance blended harmoniously, while Japanese Kentōshi (embassies to Tang China) arrived in an endless stream, showcasing the open and inclusive grandeur of the Tang Empire.</Text>

            <Text>However, after the outbreak of the An-Shi Rebellion (also known as An Lushan Rebellion), the central authority suffered a heavy blow, the division of Fazhen (military towns with great autonomy), the dictatorship of eunuchs and the intertwining of Niu and Li party disputes worsened, and the Huangchao Rebellion completely destroyed the economic foundation, and the Tang Dynasty was finally replaced by the divided Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms.</Text>

            <Text>The Frontier Commands (also known as Duhufu or Protectorate) were military and political institutions set up by the Han and Tang dynasties to supervise and control ethnic minorities on the border. The Han Dynasty set up the first Frontier Command called "Western Region Protectorate" to control the Western Regions (now Xinjiang of China), and in the later period of the Eastern Han Dynasty and Cao Wei and the Western Jin Dynasty, it was replaced by the "Western Region Chief Administration Bureau". The Tang Dynasty set up six major Frontier Commands, including the Anbei, Anxi, Andong, Annan, Chanyu, and Beiting Frontier Commands, and the governor of the Frontier Commands (Duhufu) was called Duhu.</Text>

Anxi Frontier Command and Anxi Great Frontier Command were the names of a military and political institution in the Tang Dynasty that managed the Western Regions in different periods, governing the four main towns of Anxi (Suyab, Kucha, Khotan, Kashgar, and later Suyab were replaced by Karashahr), and the maximum jurisdiction once completely included the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, and to the west of the Pamir Mountains, even near Persia. After the division of the Beiting Frontier Command during the Wu Zetian period, the Anxi Frontier Command was in charge of the Western Regions south of the Tianshan Mountains.</Text>

            <Text>After 662 AD, the Tibetan Empire (also known as Tubo) and Tang dynasty repeatedly fought over the four towns of Anxi. From 692 AD to the An-Shi Rebellion (also known as An Lushan Rebellion, 755–763 AD), the situation in Anxi was relatively stable. After the outbreak of the An-Shi Rebellion in 755 AD, a large number of garrisons of the Anxi Frontier Command were transferred to the central China to participate in the suppression of the rebellion, resulting in the emptiness of the Anxi Frontier Command, and the Tibetan Empire took the opportunity to enter Anxi. In 790 AD, the Tibetan Empire captured Khotan and the Beiting Frontier Command. The Tang Dynasty lost contact with Anxi and did not know the survival of Anxi. The time of the final fall of Anxi Frontier Command was not accurately recorded in historical sources.</Text>

            <Text>The Xuanjia cavalry (also known as the Black Armoured Cavalry), was an elite cavalry formed by Li Shimin in the early Tang Dynasty, and it had a certain foundation when Li Yuan raised his army. After defeating Xue Ju and annexing the Longyou cavalry, the Xuanjia army was also greatly strengthened. Li Shimin once used only 1,000 Xuanjia cavalry to defeat Wang Shichong's more than 6,000 soldiers. In the battle of Tiger Prison Pass, which decided the ownership of the China, Dou Jiande led more than 100,000 main forces to help Wang Shichong, and Li Shimin only used 3,500 Xuanjia elite soldiers to reinforce Tiger Prison Pass. However, Dou Jiande was defeated and captured. Subsequently, Wang Shichong of Luoyang was also eliminated. The situation in the China completely turned to the side of the Tang Army.</Text>

In every battle, Shimin himself donned the black armor and led them as the vanguard, seizing opportunities to attack.

            <Text>There has always been a lot of controversy about whether the armor worn by the Xuanjia cavalry is light or heavy, and whether the horse is wearing armor. A more reasonable explanation is that people wear armor but horses don't. The Xuanjia cavalry may have some heavy cavalry, but even if they did, it was in conjunction with the light cavalry. When the Tang army advanced to the Turks and the Western Regions, the mobility of the cavalry was particularly important, and the cavalry of the Tang army at this time should mostly be light cavalry.</Text>

            <Text>Jiedushi is an ancient Chinese official name. Founded in the Tang Dynasty, it was originally only in charge of local military power, but later also controlled administrative power and financial power, and became the highest local military and political governor.</Text>

            <Text>The emergence of Jiedushi was closely tied to border pressures and military reforms during the mid-Tang Dynasty. Facing powerful cavalry forces from nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes, the Tang Empire needed to maintain permanent frontier defenses given the vast distance between border regions and the capital. Initially operating under the fubing (garrison soldiery) system that theoretically required troop rotation every few years, the prolonged warfare led to extended deployments. This resulted in widespread draft evasion and desertion, making the system increasingly unsustainable. Consequently, the fubing system was gradually replaced by a professional recruitment system.</Text>

            <Text>During the Tang Dynasty, the expeditionary army commanders gradually evolved into permanent, specialized military governors overseeing regional defense commands. The enormous standing armies incurred substantial maintenance costs that the central treasury could no longer sustain, necessitating the implementation of local garrison farming. Initially, the harvests from these military farms were controlled by the central government. However, this system prevented regional commanders from promptly addressing logistical needs within their jurisdictions, thereby impairing their authority in troop deployment and ultimately weakening the Tang military's combat effectiveness. Consequently, the central government was compelled to decentralize fiscal authority - including even the management of salt pans - to these regional military commanders.</Text>

            <Text>In 711 AD, Heba Yansi was appointed as Jiedushi of Hexi while serving as Commander-in-Chief of Liangzhou, marking the formal institutionalization of the Jiedushi position. Under the mercenary recruitment system, Jiedushi gained control over military promotions, enabling them to cultivate personal armies loyal to themselves rather than the central government. Subsequently, when the investigative Cefangshi (imperial inspector) role could also be concurrently held by Jiedushi, these regional commanders consolidated unprecedented power over military, fiscal, and even administrative affairs.</Text>

            <Text>The excessive concentration of power in Jiedushi hands eroded the Tang central government's authority. With elite troops concentrated in northern frontier regions while the Central China remained defensively weak, the imperial court struggled to suppress the An-Shi Rebellion promptly when it erupted. Post-rebellion, the Tang realm became fragmented with semi-autonomous Jiedushi and their military provinces (Fanzhen) proliferating across the empire.</Text>

It was not until Emperors Taizu and Taizong of Song implemented systematic policies to strip Jiedushi of military, administrative, and financial powers that central authority was restored. The title subsequently devolved into an honorary sinecure devoid of real authority.</Text>

            <Text>The Imperial Examination System is a system for selecting officials through examinations in ancient China.

            <Text>During the Han Dynasty, the primary methods of selecting talented individuals from the populace were the Recommendation System and the Direct Appointment System. In 132 AD, reforms to the Recommendation System were implemented based on proposals by Left Imperial Secretary Zuo Xiong. These reforms mandated that nominees for Xiaolian (Filial and Incorrupt) positions had to first pass examinations, establishing a categorized examination system—where Confucian scholars were tested on classical learning, and administrative clerks on memorial writing. During the reign of Emperor Wen of Wei, Chen Group introduced the Nine-Rank System, in which designated officials evaluated candidates based on family background, moral conduct, and other criteria, classifying them into nine grades for official appointment. This system continued through the Western Jin Dynasty and the Six Dynasties period. However, during the Wei-Jin era, the dominance of powerful aristocratic clans led to a de facto situation where "no families of humble origin appeared in the upper ranks, and no influential clans were found in the lower grades", undermining the system's intended meritocratic principles.</Text>

            <Text>The Tang Dynasty's expansion into the Western Regions began during the Zhenguan era (640 AD) with the conquest of Gaochang (640 AD) and the establishment of the Anxi Frontier Command. Through military campaigns and a policy of loose rein (jimi) governance, the Tang gradually consolidated control over the Tarim Basin. Its dominance peaked under Emperor Gaozong (657 AD) following the destruction of the Western Turkic Khaganate, extending Tang borders as far west as the Aral Sea. The Tang established the Four Garrisons of Anxi (Kucha, Kashgar, Khotan, and Suyab), creating a governance system sustained by military farming colonies (tuntian) and Silk Road trade.</Text>

            <Text>During the Kaiyuan and Tianbao eras (early 8th century), the Anxi Frontier Command and Beiting Frontier Command jointly administered the territories north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, relying on allied nomadic generals (fanjiang) to maintain hegemony—until the Battle of Talas (751 AD), where Tang forces suffered a major defeat against the Abbasid Caliphate. The outbreak of the An-Shi Rebellion (755 AD) forced the Tang to withdraw elite troops from the Western Regions to suppress the revolt. Seizing the opportunity, the Tibetan Empire cut off the Hexi Corridor, leaving the remaining Tang garrisons isolated. They held out for decades before finally collapsing around the late 8th to early 9th century, marking the end of Chinese dynastic rule in Central Asia. This rise and fall of Tang influence in the Western Regions mirrors the dynasty's own trajectory.</Text>

Historical records indicate this structure measured approximately 100 meters in length, width, and height. The subsequent five-story Tiantang (Celestial Tower) was built to such scale that its third-floor gallery overlooked the Mingtang's roof. These twin structures remain the largest wooden buildings ever constructed in world architectural history.</Text>

In contrast, the Main Hall of Nanchan Temple (782 CE) epitomizes the precise proportions of smaller-scale Tang structures.

During the Tianbao era (742-756 AD), Emperor Xuanzong had already granted excessive military, administrative, and fiscal powers to jiedushi (regional commanders) for frontier defense. The An-Shi Rebellion (755-763 AD) further forced the court to acquiesce to surrendered generals—like Li Baochen and Tian Chengsi—retaining control of Hebei provinces, thereby institutionalizing the seeds of warlordism.</Text>

            <Text>Following the An-Shi Rebellion, the 'Three Hebei Provinces' (Weibo, Chengde, and Youzhou) openly defied central authority by hereditary succession of military governors (jiedushi), refusing tax payments and maintaining private armies. This created a de facto autonomy—nominally subordinate, yet effectively beyond imperial control. Meanwhile, revenue-generating provinces in the southeast (e.g., Huainan, Zhexi) and frontier-defense provinces in the northwest (e.g., Fengxiang, Binning) remained cooperative with the central government, as they were crucial for maintaining grain transport (caoyun) and resisting Tibetan incursions.</Text>

However, their reliance on the Shence Army and financial appeasement failed to eradicate the roots of separatism. Following the Huang Chao Rebellion (875-884 AD), emerging warlords like Zhu Wen (Military Governor of Xuanwu) completely marginalized the Tang court, ultimately leading to the fragmentation of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. In this complex relationship of 'simultaneous dependence and antagonism,' the fanzhen provinces served both as tools for maintaining Tang rule and catalysts for its gradual demise - reflecting the fundamental tension between centralized authority and regional autonomy in imperial China.</Text>
